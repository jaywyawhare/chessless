# Chessless - The Worst Chess Engine Ever

Chessless is a chess engine that plays the worst possible moves. It uses a combination of techniques like move ordering, evaluation functions, search algorithms, razoring, null move pruning and late move reductions to ensure that it consistently makes terrible decisions.

## Features
- Guaranteed to lose every game (if it doesn't, that's a bug)
- Makes moves that would make chess grandmasters cry
- Great for beginners (or your ego)

## Usage
Use at your own risk. No warranties, no guarantees, just pure chess chaos.
